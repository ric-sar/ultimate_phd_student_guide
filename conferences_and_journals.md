# Conferences and journals
**Conferences** are the main place to gather people with a common interest or background, showing their last findings. In conferences you will find tutorials and research presentations, and it is the best place to create your network and increase the probability to work with others.

**Academic journals** are periodical publications related to a specific field and serves as main research portfolio and research discussion.

Here is a list of websites where you can discover conferences and journals and their impact factor:
* [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/) is the wikipedia of conferences, you will find past and TBA conferences and the possibility to track conferences. This is an extremely useful tool to manage your timeline;
* [SCImago](https://www.scimagojr.com/) lists all journals and country rankings for subject areas and countries;
* [Resurchify](https://www.resurchify.com/) lists journals and conferences among their impact factor and h-index;
* [Conference Ranks](http://www.conferenceranks.com/) list almost every conference with related rank.
* [Conference Portal](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) is the portal of "Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia"

### Measuring research impact
Ranking among conferences and journals can be based different metrics. The most common used are:
* [SJR (SCImago Journal Rank)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCImago_Journal_Rank) which expresses the average number of weighted citations received in the selected year by the documents published in the selected journal in the three previous years, i.e., weighted citations received in year X to documents published in the journal in years t-1, t-2 and t-3;
* [Impact Factor (IF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor) is the ratio of the number of citations a journal receives in year at time *t* and the number of publications (published documents) of that Journal in years *t-1* and *t-2*;
* [h-index or Hirsch index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) expresses the journal's number of articles (h) that have received at least h citations.

Usually, conferences are not easy to rank and they are ranked by Tiers, a Tier A* conference (such as NIPS or ICCV) is assigned to the flagship conference, the one that is the leading in that area of discipline. Ranks are mostly based the **ERA** metrics, the ranking process is described in the following [CORE rankings process](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bKa40nheaQ3zfuXu3jSpKIw5TnhK9USR/view) document.
