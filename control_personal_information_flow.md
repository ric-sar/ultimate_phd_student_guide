# Control personal information flow
You started your PhD journey, reading and writing papers, joining conferences and so on. Although you are not taking into consideration to continue with an academic job, it is important to track all your activities since the beginning.

Here is a list of recommended services which automatically tracks your research submissions:
* [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)](https://orcid.org/) is a global, not-for-profit organization that ensure you get credit for your contributions by using a Unique ID;
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is the web search engine related to scholarly literature, it indexes metadata of peer-reviewed journals, books, conference papers, and so on;
* [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) is social network for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask questions and find collaborators;
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) is a database for abstract and citation of peer-reviewed literature;
* [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/) provides access to multiple databases, references and citations.


Some researchers have a personal website (like a blog or portfolio) to share their academic goals and research papers. These websites can be hosted on University website or on their own on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with academic templates like: [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) or [barks](https://github.com/timothygebhard/barks).

#### Measuring author impact
Let's imagine that you want to know and understand how good an author is or how good you are within your peers, some metrics exist and will help in the process:
* [h-index or Hirsch index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) expresses the author's number of articles (h) that have received at least h citations.
* [i10-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) is the number of publications with at least 10 citations, mainly used by Google Scholar;
* [G-Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-index) is the alternative to h-index and is calculated as "Given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that authors received, the G-Index is the (unique) largest number such that the top _g_ articles received (together) at least $g^2$ citations."
