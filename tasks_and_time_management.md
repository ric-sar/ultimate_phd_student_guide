# Tasks and time management
How do you manage your tasks and time during the PhD?
Well, nowadays there are ton of tools you can use, from calendars to all-around platforms to master project management skills.

Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of tools you can use, choose which one works the best for you to manage tasks:
* Calendar: [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar), [Microsoft Calendar](https://office.live.com/start/Calendar.aspx) or [Apple iCloud Calendar](https://www.icloud.com/calendar) are the most common calendar apps you can use. A calendar is useful to manage conferance or journal deadlines.
* To-do list: apps like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) or [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) can be extremely useful when planning daily activities, such as "Read paper X, Y and Z", "Write Related Works" and so on.
* Multi-purpose platforms, here a list of platforms which integrate the above mentioned tools with many other features:
  + [Asana](https://asana.com/) for boards, lists, tasks, timelines, milestones, calendars and so on. Asana is a platform specialized in workspaces and communication tools to track everything you need.
  + [Trello](https://trello.com/) for boards, cards, tasks and sub-tasks, checklists, deadlines, logs and so on. Trello is a platform specialized in [Kanban system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).
  + [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) mainly used as note-taking app with its famous web-clipper, can be extended to task and calendar features
  + [MeisterTask](https://www.meistertask.com/) or [Monday](https://monday.com/) are full task management platforms for teams, integrating dashboards, projects, tasks, Kanban boards, calendar, checklists and so on.
  + [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) mainly used as personal wiki or docs can be extended to project management, it supports a ton of integrations for famous apps like: Trello, Asana, Dropbox, Google Docs, Word and so on.

But how do you really manage tasks? There is not a real and clear answer for this question, each PhD have different features and time to do experiments, try to follow this plan divided in five activities for preparation of your work:
1. **Literature review** find books and research papers you want to read in a fixed time, start with foundamentals books and state-of-the-art papers of your specific domain. 
2. **Highlight, take notes and rewrite notes** while reading books and papers, this will help you to understand what is really important;
3. **Do experiments** while reading many papers you will find unexplored areas for experiments, this is the right time to do experiments to find new methods/algorithms/point-of-views and so on;
4. **Write a paper draft**, experiments can last days, weeks and sometimes months, use this time to merge all the previous notes and track experiments to write a paper draft;
5. **Find a conference or a Journal** to submit your work while concluding your paper draft start looking for conference or journal to submit your work.
