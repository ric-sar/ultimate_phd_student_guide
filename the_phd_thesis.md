# The PhD Thesis
As you have written research papers during your journey, now it's the time to link everything together to fight the final boss: The PhD Thesis!

First and foremost I would like to suggest you to **SAVE AND MAKE BACKUPS** of your work, although now you should be a LaTeX master with all your documents synced on your preferred reference manager and your notes on your favourite note-taking app.

The PhD thesis can be tackled from two ways, by start writing:
1. Since the beginning, i.e., from your first published paper, **ONLY IF YOU THINK THAT YOUR RESEARCH PROPOSAL WILL BE AFFECTED BY MINOR CHANGES** during the PhD course;
2. Almost at the end of the PhD, which means **AT LEAST 6 MONTHS FROM THE GRADUATION DAY**.

These two approaches are quite different because they are based on the main assumption that you really know what research are you carrying on.

Although that, the PhD thesis can be seen as a very long summary of all your research activity. The PhD thesis can be organized in many parts divided as such:

**1. Title**

**2. Acknowledgements**

**3. Introduction**
  * In which you will write about the motivations, objectives and background related to the PhD thesis object.

**4. Main object(s)**
  * All the work done during the PhD course which means organized paper presentations. Each paper will be a sub-section with the ordinary paper structure:
  1. Title (Paper title)
  2. Motivation
  3. Related works
  4. Materials and Methods
  5. Results
  6. Discussion
  7. Publications
     
**5. Conclusion**
  * General conclusion of the PhD thesis
  
**6. Bibliography**
  * General bibliography of the PhD thesis, also contains the papers' bibliography

**7. Appendix**

Rather than submitting your work to reviewers of journals or conference, in this case your PhD thesis will be reviewed by a PhD committee that evaluate how good is your work and if you are admitted to the defense. 

**Please, note** that the committee and this process may vary by departments/universities/countries.
