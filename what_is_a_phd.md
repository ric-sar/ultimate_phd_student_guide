# What is a PhD
PhD stands for **Ph**ilosophiae **D**octor in latin or most commonly Doctor of Philosofy and it is the highest level of academic qualification. The main goal of PhD is to do research in a specific topic trying to make some research advance.

According to [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/) the average share of 25-34 year-olds with a tertiary qualification increased from 27% in 2000 to 48% in 2021 across OECD countries.

## Why you should do a PhD
If you have found and actually reading this repository means that you should be interested in doing a PhD. From a student point of view this is not an ordinary degree qualification, it can be seen as an ambitious goal to make the difference in science by producing research and defend the final dissertation of your studies.
To understand if you are really interested in we can make some assumptions on what a **PhD is not**:
- The right and easy way to make money, a PhD student with scholarship earns less than a traditional industry worker in the same field;
- A "real job", the working hours are higher than an ordinary 9 to 5 job, there is a high probability that you will study during weekends and work at night to submit a paper for a conference or a journal;
- A demonstration that you are smarter than others;
- The (only) way to do research or at least not in academia;
- A way to negotiate your salary during the hiring process.

To summarize, if your first concern is to make money and having a good work-life balance maybe PhD is not for you.

So, what to expect from a PhD? If you are eager to know or know more, a fast reader, an ambitious and stubborn thinking head coupled with luck and **vocation** to teach, maybe you can start _thinking_ about enrolling in a PhD course.


## How to find a PhD
Finding a PhD is not an easy task, especially to whom want to be an expert in a very niche domain.

The main way to find a PhD is through **reference**. Usually your thesis supervisor at Bachelor or Master Degree can help in the process by providing a nice cover letter to the chosen university. Also, having **potential advisors** may help to join in a specific lab or school.

Alternatively, you can look bt yourself on top universities websites (take a look at [QS University ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings)) which list all their open PhD positions with application guidelines and (usually yearly) deadlines.
Some portals to look for PhD courses exist but they do not list every PhD position.
Here you a list of portals to look for:
* [Find A PhD](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/)
* [PhD Portal](https://www.phdportal.com/)

Last but not least, having some publications and a good background (i.e., good universities with high GPA) can help during the application.

PhD courses are different among countries, you can find PhD:
* With a different completion time (5 or 6 years in US vs 3 to 4 years in European countries);
* With or without scholarship;
* With companies or institutions;
* With exchange research period among universities or research centers.


## Research proposal
The research proposal is the key document to your PhD application. The research proposal should be structured _like_ a research paper (more information in [What is a research paper section](https://github.com/ric-sar/ultimate_phd_student_guide/blob/main/what_is_a_research_paper.md), it must contain:
1. **Title**
2. **Introduction** about the problem 
3. **Literature review** how the problem has (not) been solved by previous authors
4. **Research methodology** how to solve the problem, available methods and materials
5. **Impact of innovation** the innovation introduced by your research
6. **A provisional chart/schedule** plan about how you want to achive milestones during the journey
7. **Bibliography** all the references used in the manuscript

The research proposal is not set in stone, changes, new approaches, more interesting topics will come out during years. Do not worry if you start with a topic and then this topic will be totally different at the end of the course.

## Rights and duties
As a PhD student you have time to explore and study new things but not everything that glitters is gold.
You will be commited to do many activities, such as:
* Be a **teaching assistant**, will you able to teach? This is the gym of every professor wannabe. Your communication skills will be tested;
* **Helping students** in writing thesis, which usually consists in giving advice to in thesis writing and doing experiments
* **Deadlines**, no matter what you will be always late for conferences, journals, and... your life!

Ok, but what about PhD rights? As a student you will be extremely committed in research, you have the right to explore, read and do experiments.
Sometimes students struggle to understand that having irregular work hours have the side effect of mental breakdowns, try to work no more than 40 hours/week, saving time to have an ordinary life, balancing your life and your research activities.


## Attrition rate aka dropout
After this brief introduction maybe you have some interest in doing a PhD but pay attention to the attrition rate. The attrition rate is just a metric representing how many people drop the PhD course, there are many contrasting sources stating that attrition rate in US falls between 40-60%, others state less than 40% and so on.
But the problem is not related to the rate but to the reasons. There are many reasons that bring people to droput, here you a short list:
* Anxiety
* No more interest in the topic
* Lack of funding
* Prior university debts
* Lack of a proper supervision
* Job occupation
* Difficulty to persue an academic career

In my honest opinion, the main reason for dropout is related to how actually a student perceives himself in this world, the competences involved and developed, how the student reacts to paper rejection and so on besides the lack of funding or the relationship with faculty members.

If you need some confirmations about pursuing this path, apply for research-like activities starting from Bachelor degree is highly recommended. Many professors involved in specific research domain usually run research labs, these opportunities can be seen as preview of the PhD course.
