# What is a PhD
PhD stands for **Ph**ilosophiae **D**octor in latin or most commonly Doctor of Philosofy and it is the highest level of academic qualification. The main goal of PhD is to do research in a specific topic trying to make some research advance.

### Why you should do a PhD
If you have found and actually reading this repository means that you should be interested in doing a PhD. From a student point of view this is not an ordinary degree qualification, it can be seen as an ambitious goal to make the difference in science by producing research and defend the final dissertation of your studies.
To understand if you are really interested in we can make some assumption on what a **PhD is not**:
- The right and easy way to make money, a PhD student with a scholarship earns less than a traditional industry worker in the same field
- A "real job", the working hours are higher than an ordinary 9 to 5 job, there is a high probability that you will study during weekends and work at night to submit a paper for a conference or journal
- A demonstration that you are smarter than others
- The (only) way to do research, or at least not in academia
- A way to being paid more in for future industry application.

To summarize, if your first concern is to make money and having a good work-life balance maybe PhD is not for you.

So, what to expect from a PhD? If you are eager to know or know more, a fast reader, an ambitious and stubborn thinking head coupled with a lucky and **vocation** to teach, maybe you can _think_ about enrolling in a PhD course.

#### How to find a PhD
Finding a PhD is not an easy task, especially to whom want to be an expert in a very niche domain.

The main way to find a PhD is through reference. Usually your thesis supervisor at Bachelor or Master Degree can help in the process by providing a nice cover letter to the chosen university. Also, having potential advisors may help to join in a specific lab or school.
Alternatively, you can look bt yourself on top universities websites (take a look at [QS University ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) which list all their PhDs position with application guidelines and (usually yearly) deadlines.
Some portals to look for PhD courses exist but they do not list every PhD.
Here you a list of portals to look for:
* [Find A PhD](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/)
* [PhD Portal](https://www.phdportal.com/)

Last but not least, having some publication and a good background (i.e., good university with high GPA) can help during the application.

PhD courses are different among countries, you can find PhD:
* With a different completion time (5 or 6 years in US vs 3 to 4 years in European countries)
* With or without scholarship
* With companies or institutions
* With exchange research period among universities or research centers
* So on

#### Research proposal
The research proposal is the key document to your PhD application. The research proposal should be structured _like_ a research paper, it must contain:
1. Title
2. Introduction: About the problem 
3. Literature review: How the problem has (not) been solved by previous authors
4. Research methodology: How to solve the problem, available methods and materials
5. Impact of innovation: The innovation introduced by your research
6. A provisional chart/schedule: Plan about how you want to achive milestones during the journey
7. Bibliography: All the references used in the manuscript

The research proposal is not set in stone, changes, new approaches, more interesting topics will come out during years. Do not worry if you start with a topic and then this topic will be totally different at the end of the course.

#### Rights and duties
As a PhD student you have time to explore and study new things but not everything that glitters is gold.
You will be commited to make many activities, such as:
* Be a teaching assistant: Will you able to teach? This is the gym of every professor wannabe. Your communication skills will be tested;
* Helping students: Which usually consists in giving advice to in thesis writing and doing experiments
* Deadlines: No matter what you will be always late for conferences, journals, and... your life!

Ok, but what about PhD rights? As a student you will be extremely committed in research, you have the right to explore, read and do experiments.
Sometimes students struggle to understand that not having fixed working hours have the side effect of mental breakdowns, try to work no more than 40 hours/week, saving times to have an ordinary life, balancing your life and your research activities.
