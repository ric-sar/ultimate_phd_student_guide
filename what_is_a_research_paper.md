# What is a research paper
A research paper is an academic writing, where students and/or academics present their work to the world.
The research paper should firstly answers to a question, how to solve a specific problem or how to improve known solutions.

### Where to find research papers
Research papers are usually presented during conferences or print on journals, they can be accessed freely or by the use of subscription on editor portals (like Elsevier or Springer) which host journals.

Here you can find a list of search engines for different fields:
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
* [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/search)
* [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
* [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/)

Sometimes you can read preprints. Preprints are research paper that have not been peer reviewed or published (yet) on journals. The most famous platforms are:
* [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) for Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Electrical Engineering and System Science
* [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) for Health Sciences

Take always into consideration Introduction and Related Works sections of each research paper, you can easily find fundamentals and state-of-the-art research papers already known. Alternatively, you can use AI-powered research tools which scan the internet and find related research papers:
* [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/): Find relevant research and give you a short summary of the objective and results of a paper;
* [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/): Create a graph by analyzing similarities among research papers;
* [ResearchRabbit.ai](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/): Is a citation-based literature mapping tool.
* [Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/): Is a discovery app based on automated citation searching.

But sometimes you need to work on patents, here a list of patent search engines:
* [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/)
* [European Patent Office](https://www.epo.org/)
* [United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/landing.html)

### The research paper structure
Research paper structure is based on [IMRAD or IMRaD method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD), which divides the work in sections: Introduction, Methods, Results and, Discussion.
Actually, sections can be added to the information flow and usually the structure of research papers can be distinguished in:
1. Title: Must summarize all the work done with the used approach in a dozen words;
2. Abstract: Is used as a summarization of the entire research work, stating the question to solve, how has been addressed and the obtained results;
3. Introduction: This section is dedicated to the introduction to the problem with a small roadmap to the following research work;
4. Literature review (or Related works): Takes into consideration past and present solution to the problem, highlighting the proposed solution and differences within the proposed approach;
5. Materials and Methods: This one of the most important section of the research work, here authors will show their approach and how they tackled the problem;
6. Results and discussion: Among the previous section, here authors show resuslts of their approach, often benchmarked with previous state-of-the-art techniques;
7. Conclusion: A brief concolusion on the obtained results compared to known approach, usually a space where authors introduce future works;
8. Acknowledgments: Besides acknoledge academics or staff, this section is heavily used to state who funded the work (Funding bodies or industry collaboration)
9. Bibliography: A list of all the references used in the work arranged as described by editors' guidelines.

### How to read a research paper
The more you read, the more knowledge you acquire. Reading papers is one of the main PhD activities, but there is a problem, you are time-limited and sometimes you do not really need to read every published paper but start with reading foundamental papers of your research domain.
The easiest way to read the paper is to start from the Abstract till the Conclusion but this is a not the smart way to read and find insights in time.

To summarize, the first things to read to have an overview of the paper are:
1. Title: Paper title, will give you a fast information of the approach used and discussed in the paper, although sometimes it is only used as a clickbait;
2. Abastract: Here the authors summarize the paper content with findings and results;
3. Main figures: a single figure, if well designed, will give you the approach used by authors
4. Results: show what authors obtained during their experiments.

If the paper captured your attantion, now it is the time to compleately read the paper, math equations and footnotes included.
During the reading you will be able to highlight important parts. Highlighting gives you a fast way to focus on the salient part of the paper and also, they will be used to re-write core concepts for your own knowledge.

### How to write a research paper
You have understood how to read a paper, maybe you read a list of paper during weeks, gained domain knowledge, found an unexplored approach to start doing experiments and at this point of your journey you are ready to start writing your first research paper.

#### Reference manager
This section is indeed intended to work as part of reading tasks, as you collect and read papers you can find stressful to manage them and, that's way reference manager exist.
Among the reference managers, the most popular are:
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free cross-platform reference manager app to collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. You can use the [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) in your browser to save articles directly to Zotero and, [Sync](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync) to syncrhonize among all your devices. The free version has a limit of 300 MB but you can purchase storage;
* [Mendely](https://www.mendeley.com/) is the Elsevier academic publishing company cross-platform reference manager. As for Zotero, Mendely integrates a [Web Importer](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/web-importer) in your browser and a [citation plug-in for Word](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-cite). The free version has a limit of 2 GB but you can purchage storage.

Worth to mention the [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) paid alternative, both desktop and online version as the oldest reference manager still alive.

For fast citation worth to mention [Zoterobib](https://zbib.org/) that allows you to create a reference in any citation style by entering the URL, ISBN, DOI, PMID, arXiv ID or research title.

#### How to take notes
Although AI-tools can summarize research paper content with ease, sometimes they fail and create misunderstanding. In this section I brifely introduce to the fastest way to take notes which is to highlight text inside the preferred reference manager, rewrite the highlighted text and then export it to your favorite Word processor.

For instance, as a Zotero user, these are the main steps I do to summarize a research paper:
1. Import tha paper that I want to read;
2. Open the paper with the integrated PDF reader;
3. Start reading and highlighting with different color for each section the salient parts;
4. Highlighted parts can be used as notes, inside each notes I rewrite the content (many users use the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) to rewrite notes);
5. Export everything in plain text or Markdown, citations included;
6. Re-arrange the plain-text or Markdown to the preferred note-taking tool.

Here a list of note-taking tools you can use to create knowledge base:
* [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/): Is a markdown editor with Zettelkasten method in mind with full Zotero support;
* [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com/): Is a note-taking app based on graph database;
* [logseq](https://logseq.com/): Is an open-source privacy first note-taking app with Project Management features in mind;
* [Polar](https://getpolarized.io/): Is (an early access) cross-platform reading environment to annotate, connect thoughts, create flashcards, and track progress;
* [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/): Is note-taking tool with powers, you can create flashcards, annotate PDFs, create backlinks to help you study, stay organized, and think. The free version allows you to annotate only 3 PDFs, make 2 Knowledge Bases and attach 5 Image Occlusion Cards but it can be synchronized among all your devices;
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): Is a powerfull cross-platform tool offline and Markdown-based for create Knowledge Base. You can create backlinks among pages and also have a graph view of all your connections. Syncrhonization among devices is not free (although you can sync the Obsidian folder with any cloud service) and premium version will give you only support and access to the dev channel;
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): Has been previously cited for task and time management but it can be also used to create Knowledge Base via the Wiki and extend them with all its features. There are not particular issues with the free version, the only issue is related to the fact that is an online tool.

Worth to mention the most famous Word processor [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) and open-source alternatives [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

#### How to create illustrations
Flowcharts, diagrams, plots, figures, illustrations and so on. Your paper needs illustrations to help the reader to have an overview of your innovative approach.
In the table below you can find a list of popular web-app and desktop applications mainly for creating charts, all-around design tools, set of icons and color palette:

| Charts                                                                                    | Design tools                                               | Icons                                     | Color palette                                                   |

#### Template and guideline
You are almost at the and of your writing and you are thinking where to submit your work.

Here, you can find keyword-based recommender systems that will find the best journal for your work:
* [IEEE Publication Recommender](https://publication-recommender.ieee.org/home) 
* [Elsevier JournalFinder](https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/) 

But conferences and journals have their own templates and guidelines for submission.
For instance, they provide both a Microsoft Word or LaTeX template with guidelines to follow:
* [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions) 
* [CRC Jorunal Articles](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions#crc)
* [IEEE Template Selector](https://template-selector.ieee.org/secure/templateSelector/publicationType)
* [IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* [Springer](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/campaigns/how-to-submit-a-journal-article-manuscript)

#### ChatGPT ban
Journals are regulating the use of ChatGPT-like tools to write or assist in writing research paper, some journals banned these tools at all while others allow the use but they have to declare the use in the Acknoledgment sections ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/26/science-journals-ban-listing-of-chatgpt-as-co-author-on-papers)) as a credited author. Please refer to the journal policy to avoid problems.

Although banning is not the real solution to plagiarism problem or writing sh**** research papers, I recommend some tools to check your grammar or to ease your research:
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* [languagetool](https://languagetool.org/)
* [Ginger](https://www.gingersoftware.com/)
* [Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/)
* [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/)
* [ChatSonic](https://writesonic.com/chat)
* [PaperDigest](https://www.paperdigest.org/)
* [Elicit](https://elicit.org/)

### How peer review works
So, you have written your first research paper, find a proper journal, applied the template and followed the journal guidelines, now it's time to review your work!
Paper review is based on peer review process, after uploading your draft to the journal's portal, a set of experts (peers) in the research paper domain will review your draft.
Review can be divided in:
* Single blind: experts will know authors name, this may induce biases
* Double blind: both experts and authors are unknown, this process will avoid biases at all.

Journals' policy give to experts a pre-determined time to carry out their decision, which can usually be:
* Accepted
* Acceptable with (major or minor) revisions 
* Rejected

Authors after received decisions will answer to all the questions carried out by reviewers and propose a new draft with all the applied changes (usually authors deliver two drafts, one with highlighted changes and one without to help peers to easily spot changes).

Depending on the journal's policy the review process can last many weeks or months and sometimes authors are allowed only to propose changes once before a complete reject decision (this may happen in case of major revision and unsatisfactory provided changes and answers).

But what actually peers look when doing a review?

Empirically, experienced peers due to their domain knowledge will first look at:
* Materials and methods
* Discussion and results

They will spot weaknesses easily knowing the current state-of-the-art and how much novelty has been proposed.

While, non-experienced reviewers will take a look at the whole research paper, they will check for:
* Grammar
* Coherence in related works
* Properly citations and references
* Materials and methods
* Discussion and results

Knowing this different approach in experienced and non-experience peers, the work of a good journal's editor is to find a good trade-off within reviewers and they will usually choose three reviewers with a high domain knowledge, medium knowledge and almost no experience in peer review.

Remember that being a reviewer will help you to improve writing by spotting errors before submitting a work. Also, this will gain some experience in fast reading and increase your domain knowledge.

Last but not least, review process is voluntary based, this means that peers have usually no interest in fight against you and your work, if the decision is related to major revision or reject this is usually related to lack of:
* Scope: the article does not fit the journal research field
* Novelty: mixing and matching previous works without adding any novelty
* Data: proposing a work without data, or closed data or by cherrypicking is not a good idea
* Clarity: this is mainly related to non english speakers, they need to improve and check the grammar

#### Plagiarism and ChatGPT detector
Editors apply a plagiarism detector to the submitted materials. Usually large editors (such as IEEE or Elsevier) use [Similarity Check by Crossref and iThenticate](https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/).

Taking into consideration the massive use of ChatGPT-like tools, here you can find an alternative list of tools to detect it:
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/plagiarism-checker)
* [GTPZero](https://gptzero.me/)
* [Originality.ai](https://originality.ai/)
* [DetectGPT](https://detectgpt.ericmitchell.ai/)
